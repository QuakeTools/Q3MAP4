you renamed q3map2.h to q3map4.h so all hell has broken loose, maybe there's some way to mass-update all the files looking for q3map2.h?

branding is important (why move to q3map4 down to the code?)  because all of the code will eventually be modified in some way

*maybe optimizing modern linux kernel calls?  system calls?
*linux only
*64 bit only?
*reduced code base
*opencl support, hopefully for bsp vis and light, not just light
*rewritten makefile from scratch
*static builds

glib is why pcre is being pulled in as a dynamic library
so far, glib seems to be used for utf8 conversion...not sure why exactly, but it might be tossable


q3map4-NOXML...as of now....produces an identically sized executable even though several calls to XML were commented out

james suggests outputting assembly output and running a diff between them
